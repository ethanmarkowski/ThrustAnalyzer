# ThrustAnalyzer

This repository contains firmware that I developed for an embedded system project that I constructed for the purposes of conducting thrust analysis of brushless DC motor/ESC/propeller combinations. The system is based around an Arduino Mega and is capable of measuring voltage, current, and thrust generation. The system can be plugged directly into the motor controller and will generate the necessary control signal with both manual throttle control and automated throttle patterns. The data is displayed on the integrated display and saved to a microSD card for further processing and analysis.
